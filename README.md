*Romaka, RomakaV, RomakaRMKA, Romaka Stellarion, Shaina Veryllis, all these guys.*

Former computer science student turned video game dev student, fell in the goofy shadow realm and dropped my studies to go flip burgers.
Slowly but surely getting back in the game because the awful dev brainrot got a hold of me again and I like staying up at 4am yelling at a shell.

I have experience with C# (mainly with Unity), Unreal Blueprints, Javascript, Python and Ruby (if my amateurish scripting on RPG Maker XP when I was 12 counts).

I'm also a game modder (mostly on FFXIV, but you might see me pop up here and there).
